# kwdstudio.github.io

## Local development

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`
   * The app will start on http://localhost:4000.

Edit Sass/JavaScript files in the `src/` directory. The browser will auto-reload when changes are detected.

Committing will take a bit longer than usual, as production-ready CSS/JS will be built automatically using a git hook.
